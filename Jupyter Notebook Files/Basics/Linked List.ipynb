    "\n",
    "Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. It is basically the preemptive version of First come First Serve CPU Scheduling algorithm. Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique. The period of time for which a process or job is allowed to run in a pre-emptive method is called a time quantum. Each process or job present in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for that time quantum, if the execution of the process is completed during that time then the process will end else the process will go back to the waiting table and wait for its next turn to complete the execution.\n",

    "### What is Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.\n",
    "![Linked List](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220816144425/LLdrawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Linked List? \n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The size of the arrays is fixed:** So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.\n",
    "- **Insertion of a new element / Deletion of an existing element in an array of elements is expensive:** The room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted. But in Linked list if we have the head node then we can traverse to any node through it and insert a new node at the required position.\n",
